  A document describing encrypted fields for queryable encryption. If omitted,
  the ``encryptedFieldsMap`` option within the ``autoEncryption`` driver option
  will be consulted. If ``encryptedFieldsMap`` was defined but does not specify
  this collection, the library will make a final attempt to consult the
  server-side value for ``encryptedFields``. See the
  `Client Side Encryption specification <https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/client-side-encryption/client-side-encryption.rst>`_
  for more information.

  .. note::

     Queryable Encryption is in public preview and available for evaluation
     purposes. It is not yet recommended for production deployments as breaking
     changes may be introduced. See the
     `Queryable Encryption Preview <https://www.mongodb.com/blog/post/mongodb-releases-queryable-encryption-preview/>`_
     blog post for more information.
